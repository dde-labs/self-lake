# Apache Hudi

Hudi-rs uses Apache Arrow under the hood, which makes it easily compatible with
other Arrow-native libraries and tools. 
Apache Arrow is a columnar in-memory data representation that can be utilized
by any processing engine. Arrow is neither a storage nor an execution engine; 
it serves as a language-agnostic standard for in-memory processing and data 
transport.
This means that when two systems "speak" Arrow, thereâ€™s no need for additional 
serialization and deserialization of data during transport, enabling seamless 
interoperability and reducing costs.

Hudi-rs scans the records from a Hudi table sitting in a local storage or any
cloud object store (such as S3) and puts them out into [Arrow RecordBatches](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.RecordBatch.html#).

!!! note

    A record batch is a collection of equal-length arrays that conform to a specific
    schema. It is a table-like data structure, essentially a sequence of fields,
    where each field is a contiguous Arrow array.
