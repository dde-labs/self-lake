# Self: lakeHouse

This project was created for research and develop with lake storage engines like
DeltaLake, IceBerg, etc.

## :round_pushpin: Prerequisite

```dotenv
PYICEBERG_HOME=<PROJECT-PATH>
```

## :speech_balloon: Contribute

I do not think this project will go around the world because it has specific propose,
and you can create by your coding without this project dependency for long term
solution. So, on this time, you can open [the GitHub issue on this project :raised_hands:](https://github.com/dde-labs/self-lake/issues)
for fix bug or request new feature if you want it.
